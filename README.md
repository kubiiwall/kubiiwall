## Key Security Threats & Compliance Challenges that **Kubiiwall** addresses   

### Security Threats for LLM/SLM & AI Applications  
- **Model Exploitation & Prompt Injection** – Malicious prompts or queries manipulating model behavior.  
- **Data Poisoning Attacks** – Injection of corrupted or malicious data into training or fine-tuning pipelines.  
- **API Abuse & Anomalies** – Transaction-level anomalies like overuse, scraping, brute-force queries, and credential misuse.  
- **Adversarial Attacks** – Crafted inputs to mislead models, leading to incorrect or unsafe outputs.  
- **Identity & Access Risks** – Unauthorized user access, privilege escalation, weak API key protection.  
- **Data Leakage** – Sensitive PII, proprietary data, or secrets inadvertently exposed through model outputs.  
- **Runtime Threats** – Exploiting vulnerabilities in deployment environments (cloud, edge, gateway).  

### Compliance & Auditing Requirements  
- **Global Regulations Alignment** – GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act.  
- **AI-Specific Compliance** – Model explainability, bias detection, fairness audits, transparency logs.  
- **Identity & Access Governance** – Role-based access, multi-factor enforcement, audit trails.  
- **Continuous Risk & Posture Assessment** – Real-time monitoring for drift, anomalies, and policy violations.  
- **Auditability & Forensics** – End-to-end traceability of transactions, user activities, and model decisions.  
- **Data Residency & Sovereignty** – Ensuring AI workloads respect jurisdictional data handling laws.  
- **Runtime Compliance Enforcement** – Policy-driven controls that adapt across single, multi-cloud, and on-prem deployments.
